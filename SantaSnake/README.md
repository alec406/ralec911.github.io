Worked in a group to create a website that allows the user to play a Christmas themed game of snake. It allows the user to enter their high score and pass it into the database. The user can select to view the high scores and will see a list of the all-time high scores. Utilized Javascript, HTML, CSS, MySQL, and PHP to accomplish this. The front end turned out good. However, we ran into some issues with the backend. We were able to pass information into the database and receive it. However, we had to rely on an "honor system" where the user had to enter their own high score and submit it through a form. Ideally, we would've preferred for the high score to get sent to the database automatically upon completion of the game. There was also a bug with how the high score table displayed. This isn't a true website in the sense of it being accessible to Internet users. We used WAMP(Windows, Apache, MySQL, and PHP) to host it locally. Therefore, it's not an actual website with a domain name the people can visit.
